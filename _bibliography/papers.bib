The development of high resolution structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, along with the new automatic segmentation procedures for identifying brain regions with high precision and level of detail, has made possible new studies on functional connectivity in the medial temporal lobe and hippocampal subfields, with important applications in the understanding of human memory and psychiatric disorders. Many previous analyses using high resolution data have focused on undirected measures between these subfields. Our work expands this by presenting Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) models as an useful tool for mapping directed functional connectivity in the hippocampal subfields. Besides revealing directional connections, DBNs use a model-free approach which also exclude indirect connections between nodes of a graph by means of conditional probability distribution. They also relax the constraint of acyclicity imposed by traditional Bayesian networks (BNs) by considering nodes at different time points through a Markovianity assumption. We apply the GlobalMIT DBN learning algorithm to one subject with fMRI time-series obtained from three regions: the cornu ammonis (CA), dentate gyrus (DG) and entorhinal cortex (ERC), and find an initial network structure, which can be further expanded with the inclusion of new regions and analyzed with a group analysis method.},

Directed information transfer measures are increasingly being employed in modeling neural system behavior due to their model-free approach, applicability to nonlinear and stochastic signals, and the potential to integrate repetitions of an experiment. Intracellular physiological recordings of graded synaptic potentials provide a number of additional challenges compared to spike signals due to non-stationary behaviour generated through extrinsic processes. We therefore propose a method to overcome this difficulty by using a preprocessing step based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to remove nonlinear trends and discontinuities. We apply the method to intracellular recordings of synaptic responses of identified motor neurons evoked by stimulation of a proprioceptor that monitors limb position in leg of the desert locust. We then apply normalized delayed transfer entropy measures to neural responses evoked by displacements of the proprioceptor, the femoral chordotonal organ, that contains sensory neurones that monitor movements about the femoral-tibial joint. We then determine the consistency of responses within an individual recording of an identified motor neuron in a single animal, between repetitions of the same experiment in an identified motor neurons in the same animal and in repetitions of the same experiment from the same identified motor neuron in different animals. We found that delayed transfer entropy measures were consistent for a given identified neuron within and between animals and that they predict neural connectivity for the fast extensor tibiae motor neuron.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry Objectives: Hippocampal hyperactivation marks preclinical dementia pathophysiology, potentially due to differences in the connectivity of specific medial temporal lobe structures. Our aims were to characterize the resting-state functional connectivity of medial temporal lobe sub-structures in older adults, and evaluate whether specific substructural (rather than global) functional connectivity relates to memory function. Methods: In 15 adults (mean age: 69 years), we evaluated the resting state functional connectivity of medial temporal lobe substructures: dentate/Cornu Ammonis (CA) 4, CA1, CA2/3, subiculum, the molecular layer, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampus. We used 7-Tesla susceptibility weighted imaging and magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequences to segment substructures of the hippocampus, which were used as structural seeds for examining functional connectivity in a resting BOLD sequence. We then assessed correlations between functional connectivity with memory performance (short and long delay free recall on the California Verbal Learning Test [CVLT]). Results: All the seed regions had significant connectivity within the temporal lobe (including the fusiform, temporal, and lingual gyri). The left CA1 was the only seed with significant functional connectivity to the amygdala. The left entorhinal cortex was the only seed to have significant functional connectivity with frontal cortex (anterior cingulate and superior frontal gyrus). Only higher left dentate{\textendash}left lingual connectivity was associated with poorer CVLT performance (Spearman r = -0.81, p = 0.0003, Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate: 0.01) after multiple comparison correction. Conclusions: Rather than global hyper-connectivity of the medial temporal lobe, left dentate{\textendash}lingual connectivity may provide a specific assay of medial temporal lobe hyper-connectivity relevant to memory in aging.},
