I'm interested in the interaction between humans and digital information. My experience in computer engineering and computational sciences led me to reflect on how most of our work today revolves around manipulating informational entities via electronic interfaces. My aim is thus to develop both reflective and practical projects that would lead to a meaningful, true and virtuous interaction with these technologies and the world. For this, I work interdisciplinarily at the interfaces between data science, human-computer interaction (HCI), hermeneutics, philosophy and science and technology studies (STS).

I'm a Christian. I believe that there is a deep connection between our interaction with technology and our relationship with the sacred. Thus, I'm also interested in exploring connections between information and theology as a way to (re?)connect the dynamics between work and worship in contemporary life. I've been trying to do that in the most fair and respectful way I can, such that neither technology and religion ends up unjustly reduced in the process.

I'm also big fan of modern board games, fantastic landscapes and music that alludes to them.

I'm originally from Po√ßos de Caldas, Brazil :brazil:
