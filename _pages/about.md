I'm interested in the interaction between humans and information. My experience in computer engineering and computational sciences led me to reflect on how most of our work today revolves around manipulating informational entities via electronic interfaces. My aim is thus to develop both reflective and practical projects that would lead to technology that better leads our experience of the world towards what is meaningful, true and virtuous. For this, I work interdisciplinarily in the interfaces between data science, human-computer interaction (HCI), philosophy and science and technology studies (STS).

I'm a Christian. Technology, and specifically information, have religious meaning - i.e., there is a deep connection between our interaction with technology and our relationship with the sacred. I've been seeking to explore connections between these two fields with the intent to (re?)connect the dynamics between labor and liturgy in our contemporary life. And I've been trying to do that in the most fair and respectful way I can, such that neither technology nor religion ends up reduced unjustly in the process.

I'm also big fan of modern board games, fantastic landscapes and music that alludes to them. I was born in Poços de Caldas, Brazil :brazil: 


# Doing research with me
# I welcome students who are interested in human-computer interaction, machine learning, data science, interactive visualization, and Christian perspectives on data, information and computing. I have a range of ideas and ongoing projects, but bring your own interests too! Please contact me via email (Calvin: ka37) or Teams.
