I'm interested in the interaction between humans and information. My experience in computer engineering and computational sciences led me to reflect on how most of our work today revolves around manipulating informational entities via electronic interfaces. My aim is thus to develop both reflective and practical projects that would lead to technology that better leads our experience of the world towards what is meaningful, true and virtuous. For this, I work interdisciplinarily in the interfaces between data science, human-computer interaction (HCI), philosophy and science and technology studies (STS).

I'm a Christian. Thus, I believe that there is a deep connection between our interaction with technology/information and our relationship with the sacred. I've been seeking to explore connections between information and theology with the intent to (re?)connect the dynamics between labor and liturgy in our contemporary life. And I've trying to do that in the most fair and respectful way I can, such that neither technology nor religion ends up reduced unjustly in the process.

I'm also big fan of modern board games, fantastic landscapes and music that alludes to them.

I was born in Po√ßos de Caldas, Brazil :brazil:
