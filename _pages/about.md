I’m interested in the way that human beings live with digital information. My experience in computer engineering and computational sciences has led me to think about how most of our activities today revolves around manipulating informational entities via electronic interfaces. Therefore, my research goal is to develop both reflective and practical projects that would lead to a meaningful, true and virtuous interaction with these technologies and the world around. For this, I draw from interdisciplinary studies at the interfaces between data science, human-computer interaction (HCI), media theory and science and technology studies (STS).

As a Christian, I also believe that there is a deep connection between the way we interact with technology and our relationship with the sacred. Thus, I'm also interested in exploring connections between information technology and spirituality as a way to (re?)connect the dynamics between work and worship in contemporary life. And, of course, I acknowledge the need to do that in the most fair and respectful way possible, such that neither technology or religion ends up unjustly represented and impaired in the process.

I'm also big fan of modern board games, fantastic landscapes and music that alludes to them.

I'm originally from Poços de Caldas, Brazil :brazil:
