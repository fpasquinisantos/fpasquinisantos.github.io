# main guiding questions

## 1. Information Technology and the Common Good
- What is the role of information in a good society? What good can it really achieve - and what harm?
- What is the nature of information? How does it relate to reality, truth, knowledge and meaning?
- How should information be stored, transmitted and processed? How does it modulate our experiences of visibility, memory and presence?
- How do we remain present to truth and to others in a world of hyperreality and mediated interfaces (screens, feeds, LLMs)? How to limit these, and how to give them their proper place?
- How to devise frameworks that could guide us in discerning information technology for the common good?

## 2. Computational Modeling and Simulation
- What sense can we make of the world through computational models and simulations?
- How do data science practices transform reality into data, and what gets lost in this translation?
- What are the pitfalls of dysfunctional sensemaking in models and simulations (confirmation bias, underdetermination, Duhemâ€“Quine problem)?

## 3. Digital Labor
- How is digital labor performed and what are its implications for workers and society?
- How does software shape the nature of work and labor relations?
- What new venues can be sought in terms of governance, cooperativism and commons economy?
- How should we organize and work collectively in this permanent state of crisis brought by social acceleration (Hartmut Rosa)?

## my approach to tackling current issues surrounding generative AI
I'm in computer science, so I'm asked about generative AI all the time, even though it is not my main research area. Still, from the perspective of my research interests around a philosophy of information, I usually make questions about how LLMs are changing our experience of reality. For example:
- How is generative AI changing our experience of truth, knowledge and expertise? Specifically: how is it creating "illusions of knowledge" and how can we counter this?
- How is generative AI changing our experience of people? (i.e., they are simulating people)
- How could generative AI be trapping us in an closed/informationally-produced world? (A Matrix?)
- How is it affecting work temporality, social acceleation and our experience of craftsmanship?

# research directions I have been pursuing in order to deal with those questions
1. Critical engagement with Luciano Floridi's Philosophy of Information, especially his concept of "infosphere" and "onlife". Plus, exploring the philosophy of technology of Jacques Ellul, Albert Borgmann, Bernard Stiegler, Yuk Hui and others.
2. Exploration of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) methods for designing more humane interfaces and systems - especially in the context of digital labor.
3. Simulating digital labor scenarios (corporate and cooperative) through agent-based modeling and system dynamics, in order to understand their dynamics and implications. Also, extending these simulations to classroom settings in order to teach these concepts to students.
