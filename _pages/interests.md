# Research Questions

## 1. Information Technology and the Common Good
- What is the role of information in a good society? What good can it really achieve - and what harm?
- What is the nature of information? How does it relate to data and knowledge? What is its adequate place in human life (not too much, not too less)?
- How should it be stored, transmitted and processed? How does it modulate our experiences of visibility, memory and presence?
- How to devise frameworks that could guide us in discerning this good?

## 2. Hyper-reallity and Simulation
- What is the nature of our experience of reality in a world mediated by information technology?
- What happens when most of our lives are given through mediated interfaces? (i.e. hyper-realities)
- What sense can we make of the world through computational models and simulations?
- How do we relate to virtual realities, augmented realities and mixed realities?
- What about escapism through video games and other digital entertainments?

## 3. Digital Labor
- How is digital labor performed and what are its implications for workers and society?
- How does software shape the nature of work and labor relations?
- What new venues can be sought in terms of governance, cooperativism and commons economy?
- How should we organize and work collectively in this permanent state of crisis brought by social acceleration (Hartmut Rosa)?

## My approach to tackling current issues surrounding generative AI:
- I'm in computer science, so I'm asked about generative AI all the time, even though it is not my main research area. Still, from the perspective of my research interests around a philosophy of information, I usually make questions about how LLMs are changing our experience of reality. For example:
  - How is generative AI changing our experience of truth, knowledge and expertise?
  - How is generative AI changing our experience of people? (i.e., they are simulating people)
  - How could generative AI be trapping us in an closed/informationally-produced world? (A Matrix?)
