# Main Guiding Questions in my Research

## 1. Information Technology and the Common Good
- What is the role of information in a good society? What good can it really achieve - and what harm?
- What is the nature of information? How does it relate to data and knowledge? What is its adequate place in human life (not too much, not too less)?
- How should it be stored, transmitted and processed? How does it modulate our experiences of visibility, memory and presence?
- How to devise frameworks that could guide us in discerning this good?

## 2. Hyper-reallity and Simulation
- What is the nature of our experience of reality in a world mediated by information technology?
- What happens when most of our lives are given through mediated interfaces? (i.e. hyper-realities)
- What sense can we make of the world through computational models and simulations?
- How do we relate to virtual realities, augmented realities and mixed realities?
- What about escapism through video games and other digital entertainments?

## 3. Digital Labor
- How is digital labor performed and what are its implications for workers and society?
- How does software shape the nature of work and labor relations?
- What new venues can be sought in terms of governance, cooperativism and commons economy?
- How should we organize and work collectively in this permanent state of crisis brought by social acceleration (Hartmut Rosa)?

## My approach to tackling current issues surrounding generative AI:
- I'm in computer science, so I'm asked about generative AI all the time, even though it is not my main research area. Still, from the perspective of my research interests around a philosophy of information, I usually make questions about how LLMs are changing our experience of reality. For example:
  - How is generative AI changing our experience of truth, knowledge and expertise? Specifically: how is it creating "illusion of knowledge" and how can we counter it?
  - How is generative AI changing our experience of people? (i.e., they are simulating people)
  - How could generative AI be trapping us in an closed/informationally-produced world? (A Matrix?)

# Research direction I have been pursuing in order to deal with those questions
1. Critical engagement with Luciano Floridi's Philosophy of Information, especially his concept of "infosphere" and "onlife". Plus, engaging with the philosophy of technology of Jacques Ellul, Albert Borgmann, Bernard Stiegler, Yuk Hui and others.
2. Exploration of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) methods for designing more humane interfaces and systems - especially in the context of digital labor.
3. Engagement with Christian philosophy and theology, especially in the theology of the eucharist, in order to understand the mediation of reality through symbols and see their implications in information technology.
4. Simulating digital labor scenarios (corporate and cooperative) through agent-based modeling and system dynamics, in order to understand their dynamics and implications. Also, extending these simulations to classroom settings in order to teach these concepts to students.
